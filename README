Implementation & Overview:

This Chatbot is implemented with React.js (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend). The chatbot utilises
keyword spotting to stimulate an intelligent conversation. The keywords are stored in a JSON file
in a case-based hierarchy to track the different conversation stages.

Topic:
Our Chatbot is a car dealership chatbot, designed to answer general questions about the cars that
the dealership sells and service offerings. It's also possible to make an appointment for a variety
of things such as a test drive or maintenance services.

To locally start the site:
1. Run npm install in both the server and client directory to install all required dependencies
2. Run build in the client directory
3. Run npm start in the root directory

Secret Key:
In order to authenticate the sockets, upload your own secret_key.txt file in the server directory that stores the secret key or change the current secret key.

Deployment:
The live website can be accessed by visiting https://intellidrive.azurewebsites.net (currently deprecated)
